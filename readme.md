# Aribica

Aribica is a code-generation library in Go meant exclusively for generating
Java code. Yes, while you could use some sort of templating library, that
will only get you so far when the code your generating is highly dynamic.
Aribica aims to be a declaritive library for generating Java code that allows
ultimate flexibility without relying on raw string manipulation.
